# api-specs README

## 1. Overview:

JSON files describing PlayFab's HTTP APIs. These JSON files are the input to the sdk-generator project, which uses these API descriptions to generate all the different SDK libraries, ensuring that they will always be in sync with the latest server spec.

This depot is populated by an automated process.  Do not submit manual changes to the *.api.json files.  You'll probably break the automation, and even if you don't, your changes will be over-written and ignored in the next automated build.

## 2. Troubleshooting:

For a complete list of available APIs, check out the [online documentation](http://api.playfab.com/Documentation/).
